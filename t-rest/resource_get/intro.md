In this example, we will deploy two T-REST resource *foo* and *bar* on two nodes
respectively. Resource *foo* depends on *bar*. At time t, if the value of *bar*
equals to 1, then the *fooâ€™s* value equals to **True**, else **False**.

First, we will run T-REST engine instance and develop bar.cht and foo.cht.

Next, we will configure foo.cht for *foo* to find *bar* , deploy and get
*foo* and *bar*.

Finally, we will delete the two resources and stop T-REST engine instances.

It will take about 1 minutes to load the environment.
